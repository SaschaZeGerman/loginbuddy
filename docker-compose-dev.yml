#
# This docker compose file is usable for development purposes:
#
# - it creates a private key (via loginbuddy.sh)
# - it updates the containers JAVA truststore to accept its own self-signed certificate a trust anchor
# - it uses a permission file (docker-build/add-ons/local/catalina.policy) that accepts socket connections to a few prominent platforms (and to itself)
# - it enables remote debugging
#
# NOTE: use this only for local development purposes!
