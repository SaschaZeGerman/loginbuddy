# This property is not required by default and for that reason it is disabled.
# Refer to this if a custom Loginbuddy configuration loader is required.
# Refer to {loginbuddy}/apitest/README.md for an example
#
# Configure the default loader.
# This loader will be set as active right after Loginbuddy launches and loads its build in configuration.
# This specific implementation can be found in module net.loginbuddy.test

# config.loginbuddy.loader.default=net.loginbuddy.service.config.loginbuddy.CustomLoginbuddyConfigLoader
