# About Loginbuddy 

**Latest update: 27. November 2022! See what has changed here: [WIKI](https://github.com/SaschaZeGerman/loginbuddy/wiki/Latest-and-Greatest)**

Loginbuddy is a container based solution that handles OpenID Connect flows and is used as proxy between an application (your application) and an OpenID Provider. Your application only needs to communicate with Loginbuddy. After finishing the authentication and authorization flow with providers, Loginbuddy generates a single response through a stable, normalized, interface to the application.

The high level design looks like this:
