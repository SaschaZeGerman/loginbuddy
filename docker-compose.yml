#
# This docker compose file is an example. To make it work do the following:
#
# - create the referenced 'logibbuddy.p12' file BEFORE you use loginbuddy
# - have the key signed by a public CA (i.e.: Let's Encrypt)
# - update the 'volumes' section to map the correct p12 keystore location
#
# As long as you are in development mode, use 'docker-compose-demosetup-dev.yml' instead. It takes care of
# creating and updating temporary keystore files.
#
# The loginbuddy wiki has instructions on how to leverage 'Let's Encrypt' for signing purposes!
